# BobCryptography
A simple program that crypts and decrypts strings.

# How does it work?

At this time, the program can only do one type of crypting, **abc crypting.**

This type of crypting changes this about a string:


  **-changes every letter to the number corresponding to its position in the alphabet (exaple: b = 2, z = 6)**

  **-changes every space (" ") to "x"**

  **-any other character remains the same**

  **-adds a "w" after each character**
